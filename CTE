Here is a SQL query with a common table expression for the average amount paid by the top 5 customers:

WITH amount_paid(first_name,last_name, SUM) AS
(SELECT C.first_name,
        C.last_name,
        SUM(amount)
FROM payment A
INNER JOIN rental B ON A.rental_id = B.rental_id
INNER JOIN customer C ON B.customer_id = C.customer_id
INNER JOIN address D ON C.address_id = D.address_id
INNER JOIN city E ON D.city_id = E.city_id
INNER JOIN country F ON E.country_id = F.country_id
WHERE city IN ('Aurora','Atlixco','Zalantun','Pontianak','Tarsus','Aparecida de Goinia','Emeishan','Rio Claro','Yingkou','Tokat')
GROUP BY first_name, last_name
ORDER BY SUM(amount) DESC
LIMIT 5)
SELECT AVG(SUM)
FROM amount_paid
