Here is a SQL query with subqueries for finding countries where top 5 coustomers come from:

SELECT E.country,
COUNT(country) AS top_customer_count
FROM (SELECT C.first_name,
C.last_name,
SUM(amount)
FROM payment A
INNER JOIN rental B ON A.rental_id = B.rental_id
INNER JOIN customer C ON B.customer_id = C.customer_id
INNER JOIN address D ON C.address_id = D.address_id
INNER JOIN city E ON D.city_id = E.city_id
INNER JOIN country F ON E.country_id = F.country_id
WHERE city IN ('Aurora','Atlixco','Zalantun','Pontianak','Tarsus','Aparecida de Goinia','Emeishan','Rio Claro','Yingkou','Tokat')
GROUP BY first_name, last_name
ORDER BY SUM(amount) DESC
LIMIT 5) A
LEFT JOIN customer B ON A.first_name = B.first_name
LEFT JOIN address C ON B.address_id = C.address_id
LEFT JOIN city D ON C.city_id = D.city_id
LEFT JOIN country E ON D.country_id = E.country_id
GROUP BY country
ORDER BY COUNT(country) DESC
